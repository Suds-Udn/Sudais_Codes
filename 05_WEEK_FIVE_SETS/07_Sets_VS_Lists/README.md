Start


Starting List: A list that contains duplicate values: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]


Set Conversion: The list is converted to a set using set(). Since sets don't allow duplicates, they automatically remove the repeated values.


The program prints both the original list and the converted set for comparison.

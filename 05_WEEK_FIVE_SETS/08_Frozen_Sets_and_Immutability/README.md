Create a frozenset: Convert a regular set to a frozenset using frozenset().


Attempt to modify: The code attempts to add an element to the frozenset, which raises an AttributeError because frozensets are immutable.


Error Handling: The error is caught, and a message is printed showing that frozensets cannot be modified.


The program prints the frozenset after the attempt to show that it remains unchanged.

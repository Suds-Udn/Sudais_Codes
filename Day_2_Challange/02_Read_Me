Ask the user for the temperature outside

Inform user that I will help them dress accordingly

Temperature gets stored in a variable called temperature

if temperature <=10:
print ("Its cold outside make sure to dress properly and stay warm!")

elif temperature <= 10 and temperature <= 25:
print ("Its nice weather go out have fun and enjoy the day")

elif temperature >=25:
print ("It is very hot try to stay undoor and dont forget your sunscreen!")
